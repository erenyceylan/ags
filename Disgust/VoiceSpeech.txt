&2 A gentleman enters a restaurant.
&3 Red tables, red counter, red menu...
&4 Delicious looking burgers, smell of hot oil and soft potatoes...
&5 "Nothing has changed, it seems!"
&6 Says the gentleman. Nothing changed, except for him.
&7 When he left this place 25 years ago, he was young and tough.
&8 Now he is as soft as those potatoes.
&9 He tries to think other things.
&10 He thinks his purpose, yes he has a purpose and he need to do,
&11 Do what he couldn't 25 years ago.
&12 He walks to counter and orders a side salad with ranch dressing,
&13 Just like he did 25 years ago, in different circumstances.
&14 He takes his tray and sits on one of the tables.
&15 He'd love to taste the side salad, but that's not why he's here.
&16 He has no time to sit and eat.
&17 He has something to do first.
&18 He looks at voucher: 3323. Even password to restrooms didn't change.
&19 "It still reads same word..."
&20 He thinks. And slowly stands up.
&21 He takes a deep breath befor entering restrooms.
&22 And here he is again. He feels good when he realises something has changed.
&23 But no red walls anymore. They are all gray now.
&24 He looks to gray walls and remembers how white they were.
&25 And he remembers how they got red.
&26 He remembers what he did...
&27 A young man entered the restaurant.
&28 He looked like he has in hurry.
&29 He passed red counter and red tables, didn't even looked at red menu.
&30 He went directly to the restrooms but couldn't get whaat he wants.
&31 "Damn door passwords! You can't even pee in peace..."
&32 He grumbled.
&33 He asked the password to the door to first costumer he saw.
&34 The customer yelled "No!"
&35 "Those freeloaders!"
&36 The young man squeezed his fist but said nothing.
&37 He asked to another costumer, but couldn't get what he wanted again.
&38 He decided to ask to employee instead of stupid costumers.
&39 "I can't tell the password, you need to buy something to get it. Company pollicy."
&40 He would be happy to buy something, but he just left his wallet at home.
&41 He explained the situation but employee just ignored what he said.
&42 "Company pollicy."
&43 His hands started to shaking, but he didn't say anything.
&44 Then se saw something. Saomething that could help him.
&45 Someone left tray without dumping the garbage.
&46 He quickly went to tray and checked voucher.
&47 He left his anger behind, forgot about stupid costumers and employee,
&48 He forgot about company pollicy and focused to password only.
&49 He entered 3323 to keypad, and stepped into peace.
&50 Well, he thought he stepped into peace at least.
&51 Until he took a breath.
&52 Until he tried to use toilet.
&53 Until he saw the hell.
&54 He got out of restroom. All the anger he left behind came back.
&55 He was angry, more than that, he was furious.
&56 He just wanted to find who did that.
&57 He started to sniff people. Whoever did that, must left clues behind.
&58 People got disturbed, but he didn't care. He used all his politeness that day.
&59 And finally he thought he found the guilty.
&60 "Did you do that?"
&61 He asked. Guilty one just could say "Hah?"
&62 "Your guilty just stinks out of you!"
&63 He yelled. And then he hold guilty one's arm.
&64 "Hey, leave me alone!" said the guilty one and pushed him.
&65 That was the last drop. He started to chase the guilty one to restrooms.
&66 But couldn't get him because he locked himself in the toilet.
&67 He tried to push door but door was too strong.
&68 Then he remembered a red fire extenguisher behind the counter.
&69 He walked to counter but employee didn't look like let him to get the fire extenguisher.
&70 He couldn't get in an snother fight. He did must find a way to get it.
&71 He started to look around. And then he saw it. Saw the slution.
&72 He needed to get rid of employee, and there was no ranch dressing left in fridge.
&73 He ordered a side salad with ranch dressing.
&74 Employee looked at him weird, he said he forgothis wallet  couple of minutes ago.
&75 Also he almost got in a fight.
&76 "Whatever..." crubled employee and went away to get ranch drressing.
&77 After that, time went fast.

&88 Looks alright.
&89 I don't want to have it.
&90 That's a funny idea.
&91 Hm.
&92 Got nothing to say.
